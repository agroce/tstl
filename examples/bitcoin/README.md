To try this out, you must have Bitcoin Core compiled. For building instructions, 
see `build-*.md` files in: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/doc.

Also, you should replace the path into `@sys.path.insert(0, "path/to/bitcoincore/functionaltest")`
with the correct path to Bitcoin Core's functional tests from your machine.
